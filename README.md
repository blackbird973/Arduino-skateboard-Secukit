# Arduino-skateboard-Secukit

My stuff about a school üè´ project, a security kit powered by Arduino for Skateboards.
The kit contains 3 3d parts designed by me, 2 servos to act as brakes, 1 red ledstrip for the truck at the back to be seen by others, and at the front, a piezzo buzzer which act as a klaxon and 2 powerful leds which illuminate the road.

## The Idea üöÄ 
Passionate about skateboarding for years ‚ù§ , over time I had the idea
after a few accidents, secure my skateboard to avoid unnecessary falls
for lack of light, or having to stop suddenly because of pedestrians who do not
do not see me or do not hear me arrive.
I started looking at what I could buy on the internet to secure
my travels in skateboarding. After a few hours on the web and not finding
not my happiness, I decided to create my own
safety device for skateboarding.
It is adaptable to all skateboards because the two parts of the kit are fixed between
the base of the trucks and the board, which allows it to be adapted to any type of
skateboard, the supports being universal.
The brain of the secu-kit is a Arduino uno that controls the four parts of the
device ensuring the safety of the user.
A battery of great autonomy feeds everything.
The four security modules are:
A horn (piezo buzzer) to warn the pedestrians of our arrival for
they are not surprised and thus avoid any risk of collision.
Front lighting (2 leds RGB) to illuminate the road at night or in low light,
to avoid falling into holes or pebbles for example.
A rear light (red LED bar) to be seen by others
users of the road or sidewalk at night and thus avoid the risk of collisions.
A braking system exerted on the two front wheels by two servo-motors
¬†to brake the skateboard when it leaves alone (in case of a fall for example), or
to slow down to avoid falling in case of high speed while braking by
feet is impossible.
All these modules are controlled using a ir remote control
¬†retrieved from a remote controlled toy (reprogrammed for this project), which
sends orders to an infrared receiver placed on the skateboard.
