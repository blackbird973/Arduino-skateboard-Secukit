# Arduino-skateboard-Secukit

My stuff about a school project, a security kit powered by Arduino for Skateboards.
The kit contains 3 3d parts designed by me, 2 servos to act as brakes, 1 red ledstrip for the truck at the back to be seen by others, and at the front, a piezzo buzzer which act as a klaxon and 2 powerful leds which illuminate the road.

## The Schema : Global design

Schema created by me on Adobe Illustrator to present the project and the different parts.
